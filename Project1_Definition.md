###Write a program that does the following:

- Create a menu with following information:
    - 1: book
    - 2: pen
    - 3: bag
    - 4: bread
- Use if else statement to calculate the information below once a user chooses from the above menu
    - book: price = 2.23
    - pen: price = .27
    - bag: price = 9.50
    - bread: price = 1.23
- Once a user selects one of the selections from the above menu, ask for the quantity of the selection.
- If a user selects a book, then ask "e-book or hard copy"
    - If e-book selected then give 60% discount off the original value
- Multiply the quantity of the selection by the corresponding price and sales tax (which is 2.5% for all the products except for the bread)
- Show the final price
