#Assignment 1

###Variables Needed:
     - the distance from your home to the nearest gas station (you put any millage)
     - the average amount of money you pay to fill up your car.

Write a program that collects the above information, and calculate the distance from your home to the nearest gas station back and forth.

If you pay an average $30 to fill up the tank and make trips to the gas station 4 times a month, write a program that calculate your monthly cost and the total millage you drive to the gas station for a year.
